# Sub-Archive
Archives websites linked on reddit and adds them to IPFS

Requires python3, wget, go-ipfs and redis(not used yet). redis could probably be replaced with a Dapp on Ethereum later. Install python requirements with `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`


Usage: rename config.py.example to config.py and fill it out with the settings you want then run "python3 subarchive.py" to start


NOTICE: I have chosen to abandon this project as the latest reddit api made things needlessly complicated (requiring api keys for a script that only reads data)
